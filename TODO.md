## Notifications for the Web UI / REST API

`backend.notifications.notify()` currently only reaches the chat platform
(Slack/Mattermost), through the sender registered in `__main__.py`
(`chat.get_notification_sender`). Background events such as GitHub invitation
accepted/expired are not visible in the web UI or API. Options:

- Persist notifications in a table (e.g. `notifications`: id, created_at, text, read)
  from `notify()`, and show them on the web dashboard (and a `GET /api/notifications` endpoint).
- Support multiple senders in `backend.notifications` (chat, webhook, email via
  `backend.email_logging`) instead of a single one.
- Add a webhook callback URL per OAuth2 client in `config/oauth2_clients.yml` so API
  consumers get pushed events.
- Note: the web app can run in a separate process from the bot, so an in-memory
  sender isn't enough; the database is the shared channel.

## Other chat platforms

`chat.get_notification_sender` supports Slack and Mattermost only; add Discord/Teams/Telegram
when `get_chat_wrapper` supports them.
